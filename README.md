How do Honorlock's honeypot sites actually work? This repo contains efforts to find and list Honorlock honeypot domains. These lists are _far_ from complete.

`live-sites.txt` lists.. well... live sites.

`live-sites-blocklist` is an uBlock list you can import. instructions at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web. use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kurtoid/honorlock-honeypot-list/main/live-sites-blocklist` as the list address

`old-sites.txt` contains sites that used to host HL honeypots, but don't now.

`common_site_features.md` contains common features and techniques


Don't cheat, folks.
