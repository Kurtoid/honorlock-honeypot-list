How do Honorlock's honeypot sites actually work? This repo contains efforts to find and list Honorlock honeypot domains. Since we don't know how many there are, these lists are probably far from complete.

`live-sites.txt` lists.. well... live sites.

`live-sites-blocklist` is an uBlock list you can import. instructions at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web. use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kurtoid/honorlock-honeypot-list/main/live-sites-blocklist` as the list address

`old-sites.txt` contains sites that used to host HL honeypots, but don't now.

`common_site_features.md` contains [common features and techniques](https://github.com/Kurtoid/honorlock-honeypot-list/blob/main/common_site_features.md)


Don't cheat, folks.
