# Techniques for finding HL Honeypots
* use questions posted on existing known sites
* non-english questions work best
* look for simple site names like buzzfolder or studyeffect
* use a search thumbnail extension to quickly screen potential sites
* if down, check archive.org and add to old-sites.txt
* Use Google searches targeting their Ghost plugin (such as [this one](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22ghost+init%22+%22Audiocast%22&hl=en&filter=0&biw=1536&bih=760))


# common features
* simple, two-word URLs

* question posts will have two buttons, usually "SHOW ANSWER" and "HIDE ANSWER"
* SSL uses LetsEncrypt

# common page scripts
* body usually starts with two <audio /> tags
* adds "onClick" listener to *all* buttons to play some audio
* loads inspectlet
* adds js call ghostConsole() to add invisible text to page. I'm guessing this is for inspectlet to capture

# scratch notes
XPath for "real" question: `//div[@class="panel-heading" and not(contains(text(),"â€“"))]`
